'''
Comprised of a set of instructions 

A program is a lot like a recipe 
- instead of followed by a person its followed by a machine 
- a number of ways to make a solution 

Look at the world as a set of functions that can take steps 

Database - the world as relationships 
- Set theory problem 
- Describing relationships between problems 

Object Orientated Programming 
- Break them down in terms of classes of objects that can interact with each other 
- Solve the problem in a way thats as close to the problem as we can get 

Software programming is different? o-o 

Encapsulation: Keep the example easy to use 
 - Ex: Interfaces: Hides parts that isn't needed

 * Mac uses an older version of python so you need to specify which Python youre using with mac o-o 

 Recursion: Functions that call itself 
 - Things dealing with trees (Listing all files in a directory or subdirectories)

 Decorators: Function that calls another function 
 Context Manager: Automatic commands (ie: If program crashes, the data is closed as well.)

 Communicate Understanding via Type Annotations and Doc Strings 
 Oh its type script 

 in CMD line type something what happens? 
 Ans: Path (List of Places you look in your path | Directory Location) 
 Type ipconfig: 
 - Looks at the special variable called Path, 
 - Looks at every path listed there
 - looks for the program called ipconfig 
 - Finds a match, looks up what to do 

 When you import into a Python program, you look through the sysPath. 
 - A directory/list of where Python has installed stuff.

Functions 

When a exe is run 

A variable is created that stores a function which can be called for later use 

Your function should have: 
Docstring - Comments for your function that shows up when you hover over ur function later 

You dont need to have Type 
- Its to understand whats coming in and whats coming out 


if __name__ == "__main__": 
    main()

name contains the currently running process 
Entry point for Python will have the name __main__ 
 - Checks if the currently running process is the same as __main__ 

when this file is imported it wont have the __main__ name so everything under the if won't run :0

Safety thing - Ensures the function doesn't accidentally run 
 - You might know not to run the code but if someone else imported this function they might not know

__ is used by Python 

Main Guard: Is this special variable called name == main 
When you import you give it the name its known as 

if this is the script loaded into the python interpreter, do stuff. 

Itll keep running in the code?
